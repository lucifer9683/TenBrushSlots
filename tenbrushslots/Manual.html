<h2>Ten Brush Slots</h2>
<p>An extension that allows assignment of multiple brush presets to ten slots. This plugin is designed to be similar to Ten Brushes but with additional properties that allows efficient switching of brush families.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Go to <strong>Tools → Scripts → Ten Brush Slots</strong> to open the editor for managing different kits, assigning/grouping brush presets and configuring slot activation behaviours. 
    Changes in the editor are saved automatically.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings → Configure Krita → Keyboard Shortcuts</strong> under <strong>Ten Brush Slots</strong> to change the shortcuts. 
    Each slot has a configurable shortcut like in Ten Brushes. There are 3 additional shortcut pairs to help users switch brushes within the slots.</p>
<p>When 2 or more kits are set up, <strong>Switch to Next/Previous Kit</strong> will cycle the kits, assigning the first brush of each slot in the kit to their respective shortcuts.</p>
<p>Pressing the shortcut for <strong>Switch to Next/Previous Group</strong> will cycle the groups in the slot with the current brush preset and activate the brush in that group with its position maintained 
    if possible. For example, if the current shortcut has a brush in the 2nd position of the 3rd group in a slot with 3 groups assigned, switching to the next group will activate a brush in the 2nd position 
    of the 1st group. If maintaining position is not possible as no brush preset is in that position of the other group, the first brush of the other group is activated instead.</p>
<p>Pressing the shortcut for <strong>Switch to Next/Previous Position</strong> will cycle the position in the group with the current brush preset and activate the brush in that position. 
    No switching will occur when the current brush does not belong in any slot and if auto-brush is active, it will still activate the brush tool.</p>
